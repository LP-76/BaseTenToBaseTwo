# Base Ten To Base Two
CS 417: Machine Assignment 1

Program takes in command-line arguments and converts them from base ten to base two.

## To run this program 
1) Compile the files using "javac MachineAssignment.java"
2) Then run "java MachineAssignment value value value...."


## Goal for Assignment:
Write a program that receives a real number in decimal (base 10) and converts it into binary (base 2).

* You must implement the algorithm discussed in Chapter 1.
* You may not use libraries or built-in functions (e.g., Double.toHexString(. . . ) in Java or
”{0:b}”.format(. . . ) in Python)

You may assume that all input is well-formed (i.e., all inputs are valid real numbers). You need not (and should not)
expect illegal inputs (e.g., ”0.1LOL”).
